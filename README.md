# Current development has moved to Gitlab!

SWAGD will now be actively developed on the GitLab platform.  The SWAGD
codebase here will be kept for archive purposes.

The GitLab codebase splits SWAGD into a few pieces:

* (SWAGD core)[https://gitlab.com/GitLabRGI/swagd]
* (RGI Suite)[https://gitlab.com/GitLabRGI/rgi-suite]
* (Data Production Tools)[https://gitlab.com/GitLabRGI/data-production-tools]

See these individual repositories for more targeted SWAGD functionality.
